## The Frustration: Why Copying Web Tables is So Hard

We‚Äôve all been there. You find the perfect dataset online, but when you copy-paste it into Excel, you get a chaotic mess. Data is crammed into a single column, formatting is destroyed, and a 5-second task turns into a 15-minute cleanup project.

This happens because of invisible HTML styling and modern websites using `<div>`s instead of `<table>` tags, making traditional copy-pasting fail.

## The Solution: A Lightweight, Powerful Bookmarklet

**TableCopy** is a powerful yet simple **bookmarklet**‚Äînot a browser extension‚Äîthat solves this problem. It's a small piece of JavaScript you save to your bookmarks bar. When you're on a page with a table, just click the bookmarklet. It intelligently analyzes the page, captures the table's structure, and lets you copy it perfectly.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **üß† Smart Structure Recognition**: Intelligently detects both traditional HTML `<table>` structures and modern `<div>`-based layouts that look like tables. It 'sees' the table the way you do.

*   **üìã One-Click Perfect Copy**: Copies the table as rich text, so when you paste it into Excel, WPS Office, Notion, or Google Sheets, it appears exactly as it should‚Äîperfectly formatted.

*   **üñ±Ô∏è Effortless Column Copying**: Need just one column? After activating the tool, simply click any column's header to copy its entire contents, separated by newlines or commas.

*   **üìÑ Flexible Export Options**: Go beyond a simple copy. Export your data as **CSV**, **TSV**, **JSON**, or even the table's raw **HTML source code**.

*   **üñºÔ∏è Export as Picture**: Instantly save a clean PNG image of the table, perfect for presentations and reports.

*   **‚ö° Lightweight & Secure**: It's a bookmarklet, not an extension. That means **no installation**, no background processes, and no permissions to read your data. It only runs when you click it.

## üöÄ 3-Step Installation & Usage

Getting started takes less than 30 seconds.

1.  **Get the Bookmarklet**
    Visit our official website: **tablecopy.pro**.

2.  **Drag to Your Bookmarks Bar**
    Click and drag the "Ë°®Ê†ºÂä©Êâã" (TableCopy) button from the website up to your browser's bookmarks bar, then release.

3.  **Copy Any Table**
    Navigate to a page with a table you want to copy. Select any part of the table with your mouse, then click the `TableCopy` bookmark you just saved. A clean preview will pop up, ready for you to copy or export!

## ü§î Why a Bookmarklet (and Not a Browser Extension)?

Browser extensions can be heavy, slow down your browser, and often require broad permissions that pose a privacy risk. TableCopy is a bookmarklet, which offers key advantages:

*   **Zero Impact**: It doesn't run in the background or consume any resources until you click it.
*   **Ultimate Security**: The code is transparent and only runs on the current page when you choose. It doesn't monitor your browsing.
*   **Universal Compatibility**: Works on any modern desktop browser that has a bookmarks bar (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

## üéØ Who Can Benefit? (Use Cases)

*   **Data Analysts**: Grab financial data, market stats, or public data from sites like `data.gov` in seconds.
*   **E-commerce Managers**: Capture competitor pricing and product specifications for analysis.
*   **Students & Researchers**: Aggregate data from Wikipedia, academic journals, or reports for your papers.
*   **SEOs & Marketers**: Quickly copy columns of keywords, URLs, or analytics data for your tools.
